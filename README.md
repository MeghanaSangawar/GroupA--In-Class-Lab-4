## Building a Simple API Server with Go and Docker

### Objective
In this assignment, we have created a simple API server using the Go programming language. We used the built-in `http` package in Go, commit the code to GitHub, created a Docker image from the code, and pushed the image to Docker Hub.

## Requirements

### API Server
- The server had been built using Go's built-in `http` package.
- The server has two endpoints:
  - Added home endpoint (`/`) that returns a welcome message.
  - An about endpoint (`/about`) that returns information about the API.

-> The main.go has the code for the API and its message 

-> The Dockefile has the code to create an image in the docker 

using a local webbrowser, 

 -> Enter URL as Localhost:8080
 
The webpage will display the image we have entered in the main.go file.

After viewing we can use terminal 'ctrl+C' or Exit/stop symbol in Docker.exe to terminate the Container
